// This file contains the API routes for the various components. Each API route
//  calls the component's buildView() function, which returns a string of HTML
//  content. When called from the server-side, this HTML can be inserted via
//  template string. When called from the client-side, the HTML will be the
//  response body, which can then be inserted into the DOM via client-side
//  jQuery.
